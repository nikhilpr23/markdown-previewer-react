### markdownPreviewer

This project was created with the objective of completing the **second** of 5 projects under FreeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries Cerification course.

> When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the Editor, the text is rendered as HTML in the Previewer as I type.

**Technologies Used** -
- React
- ES6
- Marked(library to parse Markdown)
- HTML5
- CSS3

This project has been bootstrapped with Create React App. 

The UI has been made responsive. The test bundle in use is from FreeCodeCamp.

The project is also deployed on Heroku.
